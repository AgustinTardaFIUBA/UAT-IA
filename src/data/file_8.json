  "text": "International efforts are underway to explore the Moon's south polar region with robotic and human missions. These missions will address key scientific and exploration objectives in a region rich with possibilities, designed to develop a sustained lunar presence. To assist a trade study among six potential landing sites identified for Artemis astronauts, we examined two of those sites: 007 and 011. We find that (1) many craters in the vicinity of Site 007 excavated and expose ejecta from Shackleton and Slater; additionally, numerous craters around Site 011 expose Cabeus and de Gerlache ejecta; (2) dense boulder fields occur near a large permanently shadowed region (PSR) at Site 007 and near the point of highest surface illumination in Site 011, which may affect landing and surface exploration activities; (3) despite some surface roughness, both sites 007 and 011 are traversable and contain exploration targets suitable for in situ resource utilization; (4) sites 007 and 011 receive higher average illumination than previously reported for sites 001 and 004; and (5) PSRs, seasonally shadowed regions, and cold traps at both sites offer opportunities to sample volatiles.",
