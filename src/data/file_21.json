  "title": "Studies in Babylonian Lunar Theory: Part I. Empirical Elements for Modeling Lunar and Solar Anomalies",
  "text": "Perhaps the most remarkable and far reaching achievement of Babylonian astronomy was the creation of a unified and comprehensive lunar theory, which combined competent mathematical models of the effects of lunar and solar anomaly. The invention of the first comprehensive lunar theory, known as System A, appears to have occured in the city of Babylon shortly after the beginning of the 4th century B.C. Roughly a century later an alternative theory known as System B was developed, possibly in Uruk, which addressed the same issues with different mathematical schemes, introduced a few improved parameters, and accomplished at least one substantive improvement in the treatment of solar anomaly. In between there is evidence of transitional developments, and subsequently some evidence of further attempts at refinements, but essentially these two versions of lunar theory were the apex of Babylonian scientific astronomy.",
