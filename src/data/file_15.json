  "title": "A Study of Central Peaks and Central Pits on the Moon and Vesta",
  "text": "Impact craters are present on all bodies in the solar system with many displaying complex interior morphologies such as central peaks and central pits. Central peaks form due to the uplift of material in the center of the crater during transient crater formation while central pit formation has been suggested to occur by a number of processes including impacts into a weaker target which may contain volatiles. Comparing central peaks and central pits on rocky bodies like the Moon and Vesta will provide information about the formation processes of these morphologies on volatile poor bodies. In this study, we surveyed 248 craters on the Moon and Vesta. Our study of these central pits and central peaks suggest that crustal strength may contribute to the formation of central pits on rocky bodies and supports the notion that volatiles may not contribute to the formation of central pits on rocky bodies.",
