  "title": "Ina Lunar Irregular Mare Patch Mission Concepts: Distinguishing between Ancient and Modern Volcanism Models",
  "text": "The Ina irregular mare patch, an ∼2 × 3 km summit depression on an ancient ∼22 km diameter shield volcano, displays two very enigmatic units: (1) dozens of dark convex-upward mounds and (2) a very rough, optically immature floor unit with very sharp morphologic contacts between the two. Controversy surrounds the age interpretation of Ina; superposed impact crater size-frequency distributions (CSFDs) suggest an age of ∼33 Ma, consistent with the presence of sharp contacts between the units and indicating that mare volcanism continues to today. Models of the terminal stages of volcano summit pit crater activity suggest an age coincident with the building of the shield, ∼3.5 Ga; these models interpret the CSFD age and sharp contacts to be due to an extremely porous lava lake floor and extrusion and solidification of magmatic foams. We present robotic-human exploration mission concepts designed to resolve this critical issue for lunar thermal evolution.",
