  "title": "Leto Mission Concept for Green Reconnaissance of the Marius Hills Lunar Pit",
  "text": "Lava tubes are potentially important sites for the long-term human presence on the Moon because they provide shelter from surface hazards, including micrometeorites, radiation, extreme temperatures, and dust. The discovery of a lava tube opening or pit at Marius Hills in Oceanus Procellarum is compelling motivation for robotic and eventually human exploration missions to these sites for in situ investigations and site assessments to determine viability for habitation and utilization of lunar resources. We make the case for Marius Hills to be a high-priority landing site and present elements of lunar data analysis, instrument/payload concepts, science justification for robotic missions, and thematic geologic reconnaissance and remote sensing that should be conducted prior to any construction or emplacement of infrastructure. This is described as a 'green reconnaissance' approach to lunar exploration and exploitation, which seeks to address such contamination factors as sprayed rocket exhaust and sublimating water in order to preserve science fidelity. We are developing a concept of operations called the Leto mission for a green reconnaissance approach to robotically access the Marius Hills sublunarean void.",
