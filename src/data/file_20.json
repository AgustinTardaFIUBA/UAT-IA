  "title": "The Second Lunar Anomaly in Ancient Indian Astronomy",
  "text": "All early Indian lunar models, from about A.D. 450 - 650, used only one anomaly - the variation in speed of the Moon as it circles the zodiac. The Indian lunar (and solar) models without exception used the concentric equant, in which the Earth is at the center of a deferent with radius R = 1 and the center of uniform motion is some distance r (r < R) from that center. The Laghumanasam</em>, a short text by Munjala probably written A.D. 930, gives much of the standard Indian planetary model information and appears to be derived from various texts of the sixth century A.D. Among the rules that Munjala gives is a correction to the equation of center for the Moon. This correction is closely related to the second inequality of lunar motion known to Ptolemy, and known today as evection.",
