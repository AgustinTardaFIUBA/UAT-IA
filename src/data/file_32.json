  "title": "Latitude Variation of Flux and Impact Angle of Asteroid Collisions with Earth and the Moon",
  "text": "Flux and impact angles were calculated for asteroid collisions with Earth and the Moon, using the latest population models for the distribution of near-Earth objects (NEOs) and precession models to determine the impact probabilities. The calculations predict that the flux of impacts to the poles for Earth is 22% greater than the flux at the equator, and 55% greater for the Moon. Impacts near the equator typically have shallower impact angles with a mode near 30° above the horizontal. Conversely, impacts near the poles are typically steep with a mode close to 65°. Our new analysis updates the previously published results by Le Feuvre & Wieczorek incorporating: (1) an updated debiased distribution of NEOs, and (2) updated collision probabilities that account for Lidov-Kozai precession. The new impact distributions provide an important update to risk models, showing a 7% increase in average population risks from sub-300 m impactors, compared to previous atmospheric entry distributions, mostly due to faster impact velocities.",
