  "title": "Compositional Maps of the Lunar Polar Regions Derived from the Kaguya Spectral Profiler and the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter Data",
  "text": "Due to the challenging illumination conditions of the lunar polar regions, mineralogic maps have generally been constrained to within 0°-70°N/S. Here we generate a gridded reflectance data cube from the Kaguya Spectral Profiler measurements for each polar region and calibrate it to absolute reflectance using data from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter. We use this data set to derive the first quantitative mineral maps of iron oxide (FeO), the optical maturity parameter (OMAT), and nanophase iron poleward of 50°N/S at a spatial resolution of 1 km pixel-1. We evaluate potential latitudinal trends in space weathering and optical maturity and characterize the polar geology, with an emphasis on the Artemis region (84°-90°S). The maps of FeO are in excellent agreement with the abundances measured by the Lunar Prospector and provide an increased level of detail, such as the excavation of high- and low-FeO material by De Forest crater. The OMAT maps offer a fantastic view of both polar regions. They highlight small fresh craters, walls, and central peaks, as well as rays extending through multiple degrees of latitude, such as those from Tycho and De Forest, which extend into the Artemis region. Both polar regions are characterized by the ubiquitous presence of noritic anorthosites and anorthositic norite. Low-calcium pyroxene is largely the dominant mafic mineral present. The Artemis region has relatively homogeneous FeO and plagioclase content at the observed spatial resolution. The lowest FeO values are found near Shackleton, between Shoemaker and Faustini, and on the central peak of Amundsen crater.",
