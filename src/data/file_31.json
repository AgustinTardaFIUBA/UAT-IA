  "title": "Detailed Morphologic Mapping and Traverse Planning for a Rover-based Lunar Sample Return Mission to Schrödinger Basin",
  "text": "Schrödinger basin, a 312 km diameter complex impact structure located near the lunar south pole, has been widely cited as a prime target for future lunar exploration. In 2020 NASA identified Schrödinger as a high-priority landing site for a 2024 mission supported by the Payloads and Research Investigations on the Surface of the Moon solicitation and the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. Schrödinger basin hosts an uplifted peak ring that would provide a surface mission with access to materials that originated deep within the lunar crust, as well as material ejected from the larger South Pole-Aitken basin. Schrödinger basin also hosts well-preserved mare and pyroclastic deposits that could provide valuable insight into volcanic processes on the Moon. This study used high-resolution Wide Angle Camera and Narrow Angle Camera images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, elevation data from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter, and spectral data from the Clementine mission to produce a high-resolution morphologic map of the basin center consisting of 10 distinct morphologic units. This new map was used to plan traverse paths for a rover mission to the region. The design requirements for this traverse were based on those originally developed for the multiagency Human-Enhanced Robotic Architecture and Capability for Lunar Exploration and Science (HERACLES) mission and the Canadian Space Agency Precursor to Humans And Science Rover concept. The proposed traverse path includes up to 20 sample collection stops with the goal of better understanding lunar chronology, lunar volcanism, and the impact cratering process.",
