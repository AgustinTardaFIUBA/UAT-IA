  "title": "Surface scattering model for dual-polarization planetary radars",
  "text": "This work presents a surface scattering model to interpret radar polarimetry derived from dual-polarization planetary radar systems, such as Arecibo Observatory and the Goldstone Solar System Radar. This model divides surface scattering contributions within a radar echo into quasi-specular and diffuse components, and further divides the quasi-specular component into single- and double-bounce scattering. In particular, the increase in the degree of linear polarization resulting from dihedral double-bounce scattering is emphasized, in addition to the increase in the circular polarization ratio. This mechanism is illustrated in radar observations of young craters on the Moon by the Mini-RF radar on board the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. Arecibo radar observations of 8 near-Earth asteroids are compared to this model and the implications for the physical properties of these objects are discussed. This work provides new insight in interpreting radar polarimetry from dual-polarization planetary radar systems and is broadly applicable to all solar system targets.",
