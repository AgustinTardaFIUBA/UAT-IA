  "title": "Search for Correlations Between Crustal Magnetic Fields and Other Lunar Properties",
  "text": "The correlation of surface magnetic fields with other known properties of the Moon can provide clues to the origin of the magnetization. In principle, crustal magnetization can exist anywhere from the surface down to the Curie isotherm (770 C for iron), which is at least several tens of kilometers beneath the surface. Thus, we must search for correlations of the magnetic field with both surface and subsurface properties. The significance of any statistical analysis depends on the amount of data available. The sparse electron reflection data from the Apollo program, which was confined within approximately 35 degrees of the lunar equator and undersampled by a factor of approximately 100, made statistical analysis difficult. With the exception of a linear magnetic feature that follows Rima Sirsalis and a tendency for strong anomalies to occur in association with unusual albedo markings of the Reiner Gamma class, no clear-cut association of surface magnetic fields with surface selenological features was found. Lunar Prospector MAG/ER data provide global coverage and improve the sampling of the surface magnetic field by more than an order of magnitude. The power of this new data set was demonstrated in a study of the magnetic properties of lunar nearside geologic units, which clearly showed that Cayley deposits are associated with magnetic anomalies. Another correlation appears to exist between the surface magnetic field and thorium concentration in the region antipodal to the Imbrium basin. Both of these correlations suggest that ejecta from the Imbium impact may be a significant source of anomalies.",
