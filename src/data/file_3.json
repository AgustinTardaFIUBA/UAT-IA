  "title": "Selenographic and Local Time Dependence of Lunar Exospheric Sodium as Observed by LADEE",
  "text": "Even though sodium (Na) has been known to be a constituent of the lunar exosphere for the past thirty years, limitations introduced by Earth-based observations make it difficult to determine how its distribution varies with local time. We used observations from the Ultraviolet and Visible Spectrometer instrument on board the NASA Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer mission to search for evidence of near-instantaneous dayside variation of exospheric Na across one lunation (2014 February-March). Through comparison with model simulations, the data appear to be consistent with persistent southern enhancements of Na, while no evidence of systematic depletion of the Na exosphere reservoir within two hours of local noon was obtained. The results indicate an enhancement of the gas density over Mare regions and the lunar nearside; though this finding could mean that the weak Na emission is lost in the scattering continuum over brighter soils. Day-to-day variability is observed and may reflect a changing solar wind and meteoroid environment combined with inhomogeneities in the gas-surface interaction parameters and Na distribution on the lunar surface. We found that, due to the limited viewing geometry and sensitivity of the instrument to scattering from the bright lunar surface, it is difficult to uniquely separate the latitudinal and local time variations of Na.",
